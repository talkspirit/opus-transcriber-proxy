# Transcription Backends

opus-transcriber-proxy uses an abstract backend system that allows you to choose different transcription services. This makes it easy to:
- Switch between providers
- Compare transcription quality across different services
- Add new transcription providers

## Available Backends

### OpenAI (Default)
Uses OpenAI's Realtime API for low-latency streaming transcription.

### OpenAI Custom
Re-uses the OpenAI Realtime API backend but connects to a custom WebSocket URL with per-request credentials. Useful for proxies, self-hosted compatible endpoints, or when different sessions need different API keys.

**How it works:**
- Identical to the `openai` backend in all respects (same protocol, same audio format, same session configuration)
- The WebSocket URL and API key are supplied per-request rather than from environment variables

**Per-request configuration:**
| Source | Parameter | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| URL query param | `openaiCustomUrl` | WebSocket URL to connect to (e.g. `wss://your-proxy/v1/realtime?intent=transcription`) |
| HTTP header | `X-Custom-Openai-Api-Key` | API key for authentication |

Both values are required; if either is missing the backend connection will fail.

**Configuration:**
```bash
# Enable the openai_custom provider (required)
ENABLE_OPENAI_CUSTOM_PROVIDER=true

# Require wss:// scheme for the openaiCustomUrl parameter (default: true)
# Set to false to allow unencrypted ws:// connections (not recommended in production)
OPENAI_CUSTOM_REQUIRE_WSS=false

# Optionally set openai_custom as the default provider
PROVIDERS_PRIORITY=openai_custom,openai,deepgram,gemini
```

**Usage (per-session via URL):**
```
ws://host/transcribe?sendBack=true&provider=openai_custom&openaiCustomUrl=wss://...
# Also pass the X-Custom-Openai-Api-Key HTTP header on the WebSocket upgrade request
```

The global `OPENAI_MODEL` and `OPENAI_TRANSCRIPTION_PROMPT` environment variables are used as defaults for model and prompt, same as for the `openai` provider.

**Features:**
- WebSocket-based streaming
- Interim and final transcriptions
- Server-side VAD (Voice Activity Detection)
- Low latency (~200-500ms)
- Confidence scores (via logprobs)
- Language detection and multilingual support

**Configuration:**
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-transcribe
OPENAI_TRANSCRIPTION_PROMPT="Your custom prompt here"

# Make OpenAI the default provider
PROVIDERS_PRIORITY=openai,deepgram,gemini
```

**Models:**
- `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` - Faster, lower cost
- `gpt-4o-transcribe` - Higher quality

### Google Gemini
Uses Google's Gemini WebSocket-based BidiGenerateContent API for transcription.

**Features:**
- WebSocket-based streaming (similar to OpenAI)
- Multimodal understanding
- Good multilingual support
- Streams PCM audio directly without batching

**Configuration:**
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash-exp
GEMINI_TRANSCRIPTION_PROMPT="Your custom prompt here"

# Make Gemini the default provider
PROVIDERS_PRIORITY=gemini,openai,deepgram
```

**Models:**
- `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` - Fast, experimental (recommended for transcription)
- `gemini-1.5-pro` - More stable
- `gemini-1.5-flash` - Faster alternative

**Note:** Native audio models (`gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-*`) are designed for audio output (TTS/voice conversations) and will fail with transcription since we request TEXT output. Use `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` for transcription.

**Technical Details:**
- Uses WebSocket API: `wss://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/ws/google.ai.generativelanguage.v1beta.GenerativeService.BidiGenerateContent`
- API version: v1beta (more stable than v1alpha, BidiGenerateContent not available in stable v1)
- Streams raw PCM audio directly (no WAV conversion needed)
- Audio sent at 24kHz (Gemini's native rate is 16kHz, but it handles 24kHz)
- Returns complete transcriptions only (no interim results like OpenAI)
- Setup message sent once at connection time (prompts cannot be updated mid-stream)

### Deepgram
Uses Deepgram's WebSocket streaming API for real-time transcription.

**Features:**
- WebSocket-based streaming
- Interim and final transcriptions
- Very low latency (~300ms)
- Confidence scores
- Diarization (speaker identification)
- Punctuation
- Language detection and multilingual support
- One WebSocket connection per participant

**Configuration:**
```bash
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your-key-here
DEEPGRAM_MODEL=nova-2
DEEPGRAM_ENCODING=opus            # Audio encoding: opus (default, passes raw Opus/Ogg) or linear16 (decoded PCM)
DEEPGRAM_LANGUAGE=multi           # Multilingual code-switching (default)
DEEPGRAM_INCLUDE_LANGUAGE=true    # Append language to transcript (e.g., "Hello [en]")
DEEPGRAM_PUNCTUATE=true
DEEPGRAM_DIARIZE=false
DEEPGRAM_TAGS=production,region-us  # Comma-separated tags for all sessions (max 128 chars each)

# Make Deepgram the default provider
PROVIDERS_PRIORITY=deepgram,openai,gemini
```

**Models:**
- `nova-2` - Latest and most accurate (recommended)
- `nova` - Previous generation
- `enhanced` - Enhanced general model
- `base` - Fastest, lower cost

**Technical Details:**
- Uses WebSocket API: `wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen`
- Audio encoding options (via `DEEPGRAM_ENCODING` env var):
  - **opus** (default): Passes the client's raw audio directly to Deepgram without decoding. When the client sends raw Opus frames (`?encoding=opus`) Deepgram receives raw Opus at 48kHz; when the client sends Ogg-Opus (`?encoding=ogg-opus`) Deepgram receives the Ogg container and auto-detects the encoding from the header. More efficient (skips decoding), lower CPU usage.
  - **linear16**: Decodes audio to PCM at 24kHz, 16-bit, mono before sending to Deepgram. Higher CPU usage but universally compatible.
- Returns both interim and final transcriptions
- Supports KeepAlive, Finalize, and CloseStream control messages
- Authentication via Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header
- Multilingual streaming support:
  - Defaults to `language=multi` for automatic multilingual code-switching (31+ languages with Nova-3)
  - Can specify single language (e.g., `en`, `es`, `fr`, `de`, `pt`, etc.)
  - Automatically adds `endpointing=100` for multilingual mode (recommended for code-switching)
  - The detected language is always set as the `language` property on the transcription event when provided by Deepgram (applies to both standard and diarized paths), regardless of `DEEPGRAM_INCLUDE_LANGUAGE`
  - Optional: Also append language as a text suffix (e.g., `"Hello [en]"`) via `DEEPGRAM_INCLUDE_LANGUAGE=true`
  - **Note**: `detect_language` parameter is NOT supported for streaming (only for pre-recorded audio)
- Generates unique UUID for each transcription message
- **Tagging support**:
  - Tags can be set via `DEEPGRAM_TAGS` environment variable (comma-separated, applies to all sessions)
  - Tags can be added per-session via URL parameters: `tag=value` (multiple parameters supported)
  - URL tags are combined with environment tags and sent to Deepgram's API
  - Useful for organizing and filtering transcription requests in Deepgram's dashboard
  - **Validation**: Each tag must be ≤ 128 characters (enforced at connection time)
  - Invalid tags will cause the WebSocket connection to be rejected with a descriptive error
  - Example: `ws://host/transcribe?sessionId=test&tag=production&tag=region-us&tag=customer-service`

### xAI
Uses xAI's WebSocket STT streaming API for real-time transcription.

**Features:**
- WebSocket-based streaming
- Interim and final transcriptions
- Smart turn detection (configurable confidence threshold + timeout)
- Confidence scores (word-level, averaged per segment)
- Diarization (speaker identification)
- Language auto-detection (reported on final transcription)
- One WebSocket connection per participant

**Configuration:**
```bash
XAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
XAI_LANGUAGE=                     # Language code (e.g. en, fr, de); omit for auto-detect
XAI_INCLUDE_LANGUAGE=true         # Append language to transcript (e.g., "Hello [en]")
XAI_DIARIZE=false                 # Enable speaker diarization
XAI_ENDPOINTING=850               # Silence ms before a final (utterance segmentation); always sent; default 850
XAI_SMART_TURN=                   # End-of-turn confidence (0.0–1.0); OPT-IN, unset = disabled (only for multi-speaker single streams; we run one stream per participant)
XAI_SMART_TURN_TIMEOUT=500        # Max silence ms before forced speech_final; only sent when XAI_SMART_TURN is set; default 500
XAI_GRANULAR_FINALS=false         # Roll-own granular finalization: commit a stable prefix incrementally instead of one final per turn (fixes long-turn-vs-acks ordering); default OFF
XAI_GRANULAR_STABILITY_MS=1000    # Debounce: a word freezes after this many ms unchanged; default 1000
XAI_GRANULAR_GUARD_WORDS=3        # Volatile words held back at the growing edge; default 3
XAI_GRANULAR_MIN_WORDS=5          # Frozen words are batched into >= this many-word segments (or at a sentence end); default 5
XAI_MAX_TURN_MS=15000             # Longest a turn may go without a final (default mode); its committed segments are emitted once it is this old; 0 disables
XAI_IDLE_TURN_END_GRACE_MS=3000   # With the cap on: how long after the idle silence to wait for xAI's speech_final before ending the turn without it
XAI_STT_URL=wss://api.x.ai/v1/stt  # Override STT endpoint (optional)

# Make xAI the default provider
PROVIDERS_PRIORITY=xai,openai,deepgram,gemini
```

**Supported languages:** `en`, `fr`, `de`, `ja`, `zh`, `hi`, `ko`, `ru`, `ar-EG`, `ar-SA`, `ar-AE`, `bn`, `id`, `it`, `pt-BR`, `pt-PT`, `es-MX`, `es-ES`, `tr`, `vi`

**Technical Details:**
- Uses WebSocket API: `wss://api.x.ai/v1/stt`; all config via URL query parameters
- Authentication via `Authorization: Bearer` header (passed using Node.js/CF Workers-specific third constructor argument)
- Always receives signed 16-bit LE PCM at 16kHz (xAI's native rate; raw binary frames, not base64)
- `transcript.partial` events → interim transcriptions; optionally split by speaker when `XAI_DIARIZE=true`
- `transcript.partial` with `is_final=true` → a committed segment of the turn (held, see the long-turn cap below); with `speech_final=true` → the end of the turn, carrying the whole turn's text, normally its only final. Empty `is_final` events during silence are ignored
- `transcript.done` event → fires at stream end and ends a turn in progress like a `speech_final` (an empty one flushes what the long-turn cap holds; a non-empty one emits the rest of the turn); includes detected `language` field
- Detected language is always set as the `language` property on final transcription events; `XAI_INCLUDE_LANGUAGE=true` additionally appends it as text suffix (e.g. `[en]`) — these are independent behaviours (same as Deepgram)
- Diarization splits messages by consecutive speaker segments; each message carries a `speaker: number` field (same as Deepgram)
- `forceCommit()` finalizes the trailing utterance when the stream goes idle **without closing the connection**, by injecting a short tail of digital silence (`endpointing` + 300ms). xAI has no flush/commit message — only `audio.done`, which closes the WS (code 1006) and forces a full teardown + cold-start of the next utterance. Since finals are driven by `endpointing` (VAD emits `speech_final` after that many ms of silence), and a paused/muted client sends no frames for the VAD to act on, we feed it silence so it finalizes the pending utterance while the WS stays open. (#94 made this a no-op → trailing utterance unfinalized; an `audio.done` iteration → stream torn down on every pause.) xAI's own `"ASR stream timed out"` on a long idle is handled by the recoverable-reconnect path
- **Segmentation:** finals are driven by `endpointing` (silence ms; always sent, default `850` via `XAI_ENDPOINTING`). `smart_turn` (end-of-turn detection for a multi-speaker single stream) is **opt-in / disabled by default** — we run one stream per participant, so it has no turns to detect and only delays finals across mid-sentence pauses. `endpointing`, `smart_turn`, and `smart_turn_timeout` are also overridable **per-connection** via URL query params (resolved as `backendConfig.xaiX ?? config.xai.X`)
- **Granular finalization (`XAI_GRANULAR_FINALS`, default OFF):** by default xAI emits one final per turn (only on end-of-turn `speech_final`, which re-emits the whole turn), so a long turn lands in the stored transcript after other speakers' short acks. When enabled, `XAIGranularSegmenter` reconstructs xAI's growing hypothesis from the interim stream and commits a **stable prefix** once it's been unchanged for `XAI_GRANULAR_STABILITY_MS` (default 1000), holding back `XAI_GRANULAR_GUARD_WORDS` (default 3) volatile words, batched into `XAI_GRANULAR_MIN_WORDS` (default 5)-word segments emitted as finals — so the long turn interleaves in order (Deepgram-style: the in-progress remainder is emitted as an interim). The end-of-turn `speech_final` is **reconciled** (only the uncommitted trailing remainder is flushed from its authoritative text — the whole-turn re-emit is never reprinted; reconciliation only appends). A non-empty `transcript.done` is deduped via `hasActiveTurn()`. Scoped to the **non-diarized** path; the stream-timeout reconnect is unchanged. Granular commits before the end of a turn are reported as `midUtterance` (the owner keeps its idle force-commit armed), and, with the long-turn cap on, the `forceCommit()` DTX silence-injection is skipped when the granular turn already ended after the last audio and no turn has opened since (`hasActiveTurn()`). Flag + stability/guard knobs are per-connection overridable (`xai_granular_finals`/`xai_granular_stability_ms`/`xai_granular_guard_words`); `min_words` is global-only (`XAI_GRANULAR_MIN_WORDS`, a batching detail, not a correctness knob). Defaults tuned live (0 word-edits, first commit ~2.9s vs ~29s before); see `unreal-agents/experiments/xai-vs-deepgram-finalization/TUNING.md`
- **Long-turn cap (`XAI_MAX_TURN_MS`, default 15000; 0 disables):** in the default one-final-per-turn mode (and always when diarized), xAI commits each segment of a turn with `is_final=true` but only the end-of-turn `speech_final` (carrying the whole turn) produces a final, so a speaker who never pauses long enough for xAI to call end-of-speech gets no final at all — the common case since 2026-09-19, when xAI stopped sending `speech_final` at the short pauses it used to. `XAIBackend` holds a turn's committed segments; once the turn is older than the cap they are emitted as a final (by a per-turn timer, or by the commit that finds the turn past the cap), and each further segment is emitted as it commits. A turn that ends inside the cap is emitted exactly as before. Global-only (no URL param).
  - **Early finals are `midUtterance`**, so the owner's idle force-commit still finalizes the rest if the speaker stops. Held segments are joined by `joinText`: no space between two pieces of a language written without spaces (zh/ja/th; judged on whole code points, so Han outside the BMP counts). xAI's `is_final`s are each their own segment and are held as they come; one that starts with the previous one's words is a speaker repeating themselves, not an accumulating segment, and is kept. The cap timer logs at info when it fires with nothing held.
  - **The rest of the turn.** The later `speech_final` (or a mid-turn `transcript.done`) emits only the rest, found by `alignTurnRest`: the last emitted words are located in the whole-turn text — in the `words` entries when diarized, otherwise the text's words by UAX #29 word boundaries (`Intl.Segmenter`, so languages written without spaces align too; entries are split by the same boundaries, so a held segment with no speaker labels aligns against a labelled `speech_final`) — because xAI may re-punctuate or re-tokenise it, so it is not always a literal prefix. The anchor is accepted only within `anchorSlack` of where the emitted word count puts it (four words, or half the count, up to eight — a spelled-out number adds several, but a recurring phrase deep in a long turn must not be taken for the tail). If those words cannot be found, a `speech_final` that starts with exactly the turn's first few words is the whole turn and the emitted word count is dropped from it; any other carries only the turn's tail and is emitted whole (a repeat is preferred to a loss). Both fallbacks warn, with counts only; the text goes to a debug line. The text rest is cut from the original string right after the last emitted word: what belongs to the emitted part (anything attached to its last word up to the first opener a letter or digit follows — `20%.`, `"yes".`, `fell—` — then sentence punctuation, closing brackets and a spaced dash) is dropped, and what prefixes the rest (`¿`, a quote, `$100`, a minus sign, `「`) is kept; a rest that starts at the first word is the text in full. What was emitted is kept as a fixed-size record (`EmittedTurn`: a count plus the first and last few words), so a turn with no `speech_final` does not grow memory.
  - **A `speech_final` that does not carry the held segments.** xAI has been seen to reset mid-turn, so a `speech_final` may hold only what followed. When it carries neither the first nor the last words of the held segments, they are flushed first (a warn with counts). A held segment shorter than an anchor is discarded instead, since `OK.` cannot be told from a re-rendered `Okay,` and a repeat is worse than the loss the old behaviour had.
  - **Idle turn end and carried records.** If xAI answers the idle silence with no `speech_final` within `XAI_IDLE_TURN_END_GRACE_MS` (3s), the turn's held segments are flushed and its clock stopped, so later segments are not all emitted at once as past the cap; the idle turn end is not armed when the silence could not be sent. What was emitted is kept (`carried`) so a late `speech_final`/`transcript.done`, or a turn xAI keeps open after the speaker resumes, is reconciled rather than repeated, while a fresh turn (which lacks the carried words) is emitted whole. A record that is *only* carried words needs its full three-word anchor near where the count puts it (or an exact repeat of a short turn), so a turn of fewer than three words that xAI folds into the next `speech_final` is repeated rather than risked. A carried record keeps the count at each turn end (`carriedAt`, the last few — idle ends, and the end that makes it `lastTurn`), so once a new turn's early finals are recorded on top of it its anchor is accepted at the whole count (xAI folded the ended turns in) or at the words recorded since any of those boundaries (a fresh turn, or the late answer for one idle-ended turn among several), so neither is repeated.
  - **Other turn ends.** A held segment is also flushed, as the end of the utterance, when the stream errors (API error or live-socket error) or xAI closes the socket; an empty `speech_final` or `transcript.done` ends the turn; a non-empty `transcript.done` right after a `speech_final`, with no audio in between, is reconciled against that turn (the same text emits nothing, a tail emits the tail, and a turn never seen in a partial is emitted whole). An owner-driven teardown drops what is held, exactly like the uncommitted interim text. The idle silence is skipped when a turn already ended after the last audio and no turn has opened since. `lastLanguage` is taken from a turn end too, so a speaker whose `language` arrives only on the `speech_final` still gets it on the next turn's early finals.
  - **Diarized turns.** Since 2026-09-19 an `is_final` segment's trailing words often carry no `speaker` (the `speech_final` labels all of them); an unlabelled word takes the speaker of the word before it, so a segment is not cut into two finals at the first unlabelled word. A committed segment that arrives without `words`, or with none labelled, keeps the speaker the turn was last emitted under.
  - **`XAI_MAX_TURN_MS=0` restores the pre-cap behaviour:** no turn clock, nothing is held, no idle turn end, no silence skip (in granular mode too), and a non-empty `transcript.done` is always emitted; only the `midUtterance` flag on granular commits remains, a granular fix of its own whose rollback is `XAI_GRANULAR_FINALS`.
- No model selection for the STT endpoint (model is inherent to the service), and no region is pinned
- **Handshake failure handling:** a rejected upgrade (xAI answers the WS handshake with an HTTP response when its STT backend is unavailable — fleet-wide `503`s observed 2026-09-10) is caught via `ws`' `unexpected-response` event, which logs the `status`, `requestId` (`x-request-id`/`x-requestid`/`request-id`/`x-amzn-requestid`/`cf-ray`), `retryAfter`, the full response headers, the response body (bounded by a 1s read timeout so a hung read can't stall the retry) and the request URL. The request id of a *successful* handshake is also captured (`upgrade` event) and appended to every later failure log for that stream, so a mid-stream error can be traced in xAI's logs too. `connect()` then retries up to `XAI_CONNECT_ATTEMPTS` (4) times for **every** rejection except an auth failure (`XAI_FATAL_UPGRADE_STATUSES` = 401/403) and for pre-open transport errors; a malformed `XAI_STT_URL` still fails fast at construction. The retryable set is a denylist rather than an allowlist because the allowlist was twice too narrow — it needed the Cloudflare origin-failure codes 521-526/530 added (`api.x.ai` is behind Cloudflare, whose edge returns these when xAI's origin is down/timing out/failing TLS), and then on 2026-09-22 xAI answered **404** to every upgrade for 7 minutes fleet-wide while 404 was on the fail-fast list as a presumed misconfiguration. An xAI rejection carries no body and nothing that separates "your request is wrong" from "our backend is missing", so the status cannot decide it. The delay is `XAI_CONNECT_BACKOFF_MS` (250ms base, doubling, ±25% jitter, capped 4s), or the rejection's `Retry-After` when it sent one (delay-seconds or HTTP-date), capped at the same 4s — a participant's audio buffers behind `connect()`, so we never hold it longer however long xAI asks (not retrying at all would not honour the header either: the next media frame would open a fresh connection immediately). When the attempts are exhausted on a transient failure, the delay we would have waited is left as a **process-wide cooldown** that the next `connect()` in the process (the fresh backend the next media frame creates, or a recovery reconnect) waits out first, so an outage doesn't degrade into a per-participant hammer loop. Each attempt carries a 5s `handshakeTimeout` (`ws` has none by default) so a silent endpoint can't hang `connect()`, and `close()` interrupts any wait rather than letting it run out — a `close()` mid-handshake is logged at info as an abandonment, not as a provider failure. Attempts that will be retried log at `warn` (full headers/body only on the first and final attempt, to bound log volume during an outage); each failed attempt increments `otp_backend_handshake_failures_total{provider="xai", reason}`. Only after the last attempt does it report `onError('websocket_error', …)` (errorType unchanged; the status + request id are carried in the message) and close — previously the first rejection was fatal, so the participant was dropped and the next media event immediately reconnected with no backoff

### CloudTemple
Uses CloudTemple's LLMaaS `/v1/realtime` WebSocket (Voxtral model) for streaming transcription.

**Not OpenAI-compatible, despite the shared "Realtime" naming.** Confirmed against CloudTemple's own public reference client (`github.com/Cloud-Temple/product-llmaas-how-to`, `simple_voxtral/`):

| | OpenAI Realtime API | CloudTemple `/v1/realtime` |
|---|---|---|
| Auth | WS subprotocol (`openai-insecure-api-key.<key>`) | `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header |
| `session.update` | Nested under `session.audio.input.transcription.model` | Flat: `{ type: 'session.update', model }` |
| Streaming event | `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.delta` | `transcription.delta` (`delta` field, often empty — a heartbeat, not an error) |
| Finalization event | `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed` (automatic, server-side VAD) | `transcription.done` (only after an explicit `input_audio_buffer.commit` with `final: true` — no server-side VAD/turn_detection at all) |
| Finalization payload | Carries the full transcript | Only a `usage` object — the text must be reassembled client-side from the deltas |
| Connection lifetime | One persistent connection per participant for the whole call | **One connection per utterance** — after `transcription.done`, the socket stops responding to further audio entirely (verified empirically) |

**Configuration:**
```bash
CLOUDTEMPLE_API_KEY=...
CLOUDTEMPLE_MODEL=mistralai/Voxtral-Mini-4B-Realtime-2602
CLOUDTEMPLE_WS_URL=wss://api.ai.cloud-temple.com/v1/realtime  # optional override

# Make CloudTemple the default provider
PROVIDERS_PRIORITY=cloudtemple,openai,deepgram
```

**Known API/doc mismatch:** CloudTemple's README documents `voxtral` as a valid model alias (`-m voxtral`); the live API rejects it (`"The model `voxtral` does not exist."`). Use the full id above.

**Architecture note — connection-per-utterance:** because a CloudTemple connection only finalizes once, `CloudTempleBackend` can't follow the one-persistent-connection pattern every other backend here uses. Instead: `forceCommit()` sends the `final: true` commit on the current socket and leaves it to finish on its own (its `transcription.done` still fires `onCompleteTranscription`), then retires it (`this.ws = undefined`); the next `sendAudio()` call lazily opens a fresh socket (session.update + the same initial empty commit CloudTemple's own reference client sends) before forwarding audio. This relies on `OutgoingConnection`'s existing `forceCommit()` idle trigger (`FORCE_COMMIT_TIMEOUT`, default 2s) as the *only* utterance-boundary signal, since CloudTemple has no server-side equivalent — confirmed in practice to line up with natural inter-utterance pauses, since audio keeps flowing (resetting the idle timer) for as long as a participant's mic stays live, muted or not speaking yet aside.

## Architecture

### Backend Interface
All backends implement the `TranscriptionBackend` interface:

```typescript
interface AudioFormat {
  encoding: 'l16' | 'opus' | 'ogg';
  channels?: number;
  sampleRate?: number;
}

interface BackendConfig {
  language?: string;
  prompt?: string;
  model?: string;
  tags?: string[];
}

interface TranscriptionBackend {
  // Lifecycle
  connect(config: BackendConfig): Promise<void>;
  close(): void;
  getStatus(): 'pending' | 'connected' | 'failed' | 'closed';

  // Audio
  sendAudio(audioBase64: string): Promise<void>;
  forceCommit(): void;

  // Format negotiation — called on every reinitializeDecoder (initial setup, on updateInputFormat,
  //   and again on any new backend instance created by reconnectBackend)
  getDesiredAudioFormat(inputFormat: AudioFormat): AudioFormat;

  // Configuration
  updatePrompt(prompt: string): void;

  // Callbacks
  onInterimTranscription?: (message: TranscriptionMessage) => void;
  // midUtterance: the final commits only part of an utterance still in progress (see below)
  onCompleteTranscription?: (message: TranscriptionMessage, midUtterance?: boolean) => void;
  onError?: (errorType: string, errorMessage: string, recoverable?: boolean) => void;
  onClosed?: () => void;
}
```

`OutgoingConnection` clears its idle force-commit timer on every final, because a final normally
means the provider has finalized the pending audio. A backend that emits a final **before** the
utterance ends — xAI's long-turn cap and granular finals — passes `midUtterance = true`, so the
timer stays armed: if the speaker stops right after that final, the force-commit is what gets the
rest of the utterance finalized. Omitting it (every other backend) keeps the old behaviour.

### Audio Format Negotiation

`OutgoingConnection` calls `backend.getDesiredAudioFormat(inputFormat)` on every
`reinitializeDecoder` call — at initial setup and whenever `updateInputFormat()` is called.
The returned `AudioFormat` tells `AudioDecoderFactory` what to produce:

```
Client audio (ogg-opus / raw opus / l16 / …)
        ↓
OutgoingConnection calls getDesiredAudioFormat(inputFormat)
        ↓
  desiredFormat differs from previous?  →  close old backend, open fresh one
        ↓
AudioDecoderFactory.createAudioDecoder(inputFormat, desiredFormat)
        ↓
  outputFormat.encoding === 'opus' or 'ogg'  →  PassThroughDecoder (no decode)
  outputFormat.encoding === 'l16'            →  OpusAudioDecoder   (decode to PCM)
        ↓
sendAudio() called with base64-encoded bytes in the negotiated format
```

If the desired format changes between calls (e.g. input switches from `opus` to `l16` and
Deepgram now wants `linear16` instead of `opus`), `OutgoingConnection` closes the old backend
connection and opens a fresh one before creating the new decoder. This means `getDesiredAudioFormat`
must be a **pure function of `inputFormat`** for a given backend configuration.

If your backend stores the result as a side effect for use in `connect()` (like `DeepgramBackend`
stores `negotiatedFormat` to build the WebSocket URL), that side effect will be re-applied when
`getDesiredAudioFormat` is called on the new backend instance, so the behaviour is correct.

**PCM mode (default):** Return `{ encoding: 'l16', sampleRate: 24000 }` to receive decoded
24 kHz, 16-bit, mono PCM. Used by OpenAI and Gemini.

**Raw pass-through mode:** Return the input encoding unchanged (mirror `inputFormat.encoding`)
to skip decoding entirely. Useful when the provider natively supports the client's format.
Deepgram uses this for `opus` and `ogg` input, avoiding unnecessary decode/re-encode overhead.

Example implementations:

```typescript
// Always want PCM (OpenAI, Gemini)
getDesiredAudioFormat(_inputFormat: AudioFormat): AudioFormat {
  return { encoding: 'l16', sampleRate: 24000 };
}

// Pass through raw audio when possible (Deepgram)
getDesiredAudioFormat(inputFormat: AudioFormat): AudioFormat {
  if (inputFormat.encoding === 'opus' || inputFormat.encoding === 'ogg') {
    return { ...inputFormat };  // shallow copy — do not return the input reference directly
  }
  return { encoding: 'l16', sampleRate: 24000 };
}
```

**Encoding values** used internally (note: the client-facing `ogg-opus` value is normalised to
`ogg` by `validateAudioFormat()` before it ever reaches `getDesiredAudioFormat`):

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `l16`  | 16-bit linear PCM, little-endian |
| `opus` | Raw Opus frames (no container) |
| `ogg`  | Ogg-Opus containerized audio |

**URL Parameter:** Clients can specify the audio encoding format via the `encoding` URL parameter:
- `encoding=opus` (default): Raw Opus frames at 48kHz
- `encoding=ogg-opus`: Containerized Ogg-Opus audio (e.g., from Voximplant)

Example: `wss://host/transcribe?transcribe=true&sendBack=true&encoding=ogg-opus`

### Transcription Messages
Backends must produce `TranscriptionMessage` objects:

```typescript
interface TranscriptionMessage {
  transcript: Array<{ text: string; confidence?: number }>;
  is_interim: boolean;  // true for partial results
  message_id: string;
  type: 'transcription-result';
  event: 'transcription-result';
  participant: { id: string; tag?: string };
  timestamp: number;
}
```

## Adding a New Backend

### 1. Create Backend Class

Create `src/backends/YourBackend.ts`:

```typescript
import type { TranscriptionBackend, BackendConfig, AudioFormat } from './TranscriptionBackend';
import type { TranscriptionMessage } from '../transcriberproxy';
import logger from '../logger';
import { config } from '../config';

export class YourBackend implements TranscriptionBackend {
  private status: 'pending' | 'connected' | 'failed' | 'closed' = 'pending';
  private backendConfig?: BackendConfig;
  private participantInfo: any;
  private tag: string;

  onInterimTranscription?: (message: TranscriptionMessage) => void;
  onCompleteTranscription?: (message: TranscriptionMessage) => void;
  onError?: (errorType: string, errorMessage: string, recoverable?: boolean) => void;

  constructor(tag: string, participantInfo: any) {
    this.tag = tag;
    this.participantInfo = participantInfo;
  }

  async connect(backendConfig: BackendConfig): Promise<void> {
    this.backendConfig = backendConfig;

    // Initialize your connection here
    // - Connect to your transcription service
    // - Set up message handlers
    // - Update this.status to 'connected'

    this.status = 'connected';
    logger.info(`Your backend connected for tag: ${this.tag}`);
  }

  getDesiredAudioFormat(inputFormat: AudioFormat): AudioFormat {
    // Return the format you want to receive.
    // For PCM (most backends):
    return { encoding: 'l16', sampleRate: 24000 };
    // For raw pass-through (if your provider supports Opus/Ogg natively):
    // if (inputFormat.encoding === 'opus' || inputFormat.encoding === 'ogg') {
    //   return { ...inputFormat };  // shallow copy — never return the reference directly
    // }
    // return { encoding: 'l16', sampleRate: 24000 };
  }

  async sendAudio(audioBase64: string): Promise<void> {
    if (this.status !== 'connected') {
      throw new Error('Backend not connected');
    }

    // Send audio to your transcription service.
    // Format matches what getDesiredAudioFormat() returned:
    //   l16  → 24kHz, 16-bit, mono PCM (base64-encoded)
    //   opus → raw Opus frames (base64-encoded)
    //   ogg  → Ogg-Opus container (base64-encoded)
  }

  forceCommit(): void {
    // Force transcription of pending audio
    // Called when audio stream goes idle
  }

  updatePrompt(prompt: string): void {
    // Update transcription prompt with new context
    // Used for transcript history injection
    this.backendConfig!.prompt = prompt;
  }

  close(): void {
    // Clean up connections
    this.status = 'closed';
  }

  getStatus(): 'pending' | 'connected' | 'failed' | 'closed' {
    return this.status;
  }

  private createTranscriptionMessage(
    transcript: string,
    confidence: number | undefined,
    timestamp: number,
    message_id: string,
    isInterim: boolean,
  ): TranscriptionMessage {
    return {
      transcript: [{ text: transcript, ...(confidence !== undefined && { confidence }) }],
      is_interim: isInterim,
      message_id,
      type: 'transcription-result',
      event: 'transcription-result',
      participant: this.participantInfo,
      timestamp,
    };
  }
}
```

### 2. Add Configuration

Update `src/config.ts`:

```typescript
export const config = {
  // ... existing config ...

  yourbackend: {
    apiKey: process.env.YOURBACKEND_API_KEY || '',
    model: process.env.YOURBACKEND_MODEL || 'default-model',
    transcriptionPrompt: process.env.YOURBACKEND_TRANSCRIPTION_PROMPT || undefined,
  },
} as const;

// Add to isProviderAvailable function
export function isProviderAvailable(provider: Provider): boolean {
  switch (provider) {
    // ... existing cases ...
    case 'yourbackend':
      return !!config.yourbackend.apiKey;
    default:
      return false;
  }
}
```

### 3. Register in Factory

Update `src/backends/BackendFactory.ts`:

```typescript
import { YourBackend } from './YourBackend';

export function createBackend(tag: string, participantInfo: any, provider?: Provider): TranscriptionBackend {
  const backendType = provider || getDefaultProvider();

  switch (backendType) {
    case 'openai':
      return new OpenAIBackend(tag, participantInfo);
    case 'gemini':
      return new GeminiBackend(tag, participantInfo);
    case 'yourbackend':
      return new YourBackend(tag, participantInfo);
    default:
      throw new Error(`Unknown transcription backend: ${backendType}`);
  }
}

export function getBackendConfig(provider?: Provider): BackendConfig {
  const backendType = provider || getDefaultProvider();

  switch (backendType) {
    // ... existing cases ...
    case 'yourbackend':
      return {
        language: undefined, // Will be set per-connection based on options
        prompt: config.yourbackend.transcriptionPrompt,
        model: config.yourbackend.model,
      };
    default:
      throw new Error(`Unknown transcription backend: ${backendType}`);
  }
}
```

### 4. Update Documentation

Add your backend to `.env.example` with configuration options and usage notes.

## Backend Comparison

### Latency

| Backend | Typical Latency | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| OpenAI  | 200-500ms | WebSocket streaming, very low latency |
| Deepgram | ~300ms | WebSocket streaming, very low latency |
| Gemini  | 3-4s | WebSocket streaming, slower responses |

### Quality

Quality varies based on:
- Audio quality and noise
- Speaker accent and language
- Model selection
- Prompt engineering

Run experiments using the `transcription-experiments` repo to compare quality for your use case.

### Cost

Costs vary significantly. Check current pricing:
- **OpenAI:** Based on audio duration (~$0.006/minute for Realtime API)
- **Deepgram:** Based on audio duration (~$0.0043/minute for Nova-2)
- **Gemini:** Based on API calls and input tokens

### Language Support

All backends support multiple languages with auto-detection:
- **OpenAI:** 50+ languages
- **Deepgram:** 35+ languages
- **Gemini:** 100+ languages (via Gemini's multimodal capabilities)

## Testing

Test your backend implementation:

```bash
# Configure API key
YOURBACKEND_API_KEY=...

# Make it the default provider
PROVIDERS_PRIORITY=yourbackend,openai,deepgram,gemini

# Run the server
npm start

# Test with real audio or replay a dump
cd ../transcription-experiments

# Use default provider
node scripts/replay-dump.cjs standup-2026-01-14/recording/media.jsonl "ws://localhost:8080/transcribe?transcribe=true&sendBack=true"

# Or specify provider explicitly
node scripts/replay-dump.cjs standup-2026-01-14/recording/media.jsonl "ws://localhost:8080/transcribe?transcribe=true&sendBack=true&provider=yourbackend"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**
   - Call `onError` for connection failures
   - Handle API rate limits gracefully
   - For transient, stream-level errors that leave the participant active (e.g. xAI
     closing the ASR stream with `"ASR stream timed out"` after silence), call
     `onError(type, message, /* recoverable */ true)`. `OutgoingConnection` then
     reopens the backend in place (preserving the decoder, transcript history and
     negotiated format) instead of dropping the participant. Omit the third arg (or
     pass `false`) for fatal errors that should tear the connection down.

2. **Logging**
   - Use the logger from `src/logger.ts`
   - Log connection events (debug level)
   - Log errors (error level)

3. **Metrics**
   - Use `writeMetric` for tracking backend performance
   - Add backend-specific error types

4. **Cleanup**
   - Close connections properly in `close()`
   - Clear timers and intervals
   - Free resources

5. **Testing**
   - Test with real audio
   - Test error scenarios
   - Compare quality with other backends

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failures

Check logs for specific error messages. Common issues:
- Invalid API key
- Network connectivity
- API quota exceeded
- Unsupported audio format

### High Latency

- **OpenAI:** Check network latency to OpenAI servers
- **Gemini:** Adjust `AUDIO_CHUNK_DURATION_MS` in `GeminiBackend.ts`

### Poor Quality

- Adjust transcription prompts
- Try different models
- Check audio quality (use `mix-audio.mjs` to listen to recorded audio)
- Run scoring experiments

## Future Backends

Potential backends to add:
- **Azure Speech Services** - Microsoft's speech-to-text API
- **AWS Transcribe** - Amazon's real-time transcription
- **AssemblyAI** - Specialized transcription API
- **Whisper** - Local/self-hosted OpenAI Whisper
